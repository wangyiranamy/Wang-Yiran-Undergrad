# Wang-Yiran-Undergrad
Two-terms inter-curricular Capstone project in the final year. Our project is Electrical Actuator design which major in electrical product design. Being the only one from a different major, Engineering System and Design, I have self-learned a lot of electrical engineering and mechanism knowledge and support the whole project with strong mathematics and programming skills.
In general, I am in charge of Calculation justification in R and excel, test experiment designs, motor control (PID) with code modification in C, sensor damping algorithms in R, project management and financial planning.
