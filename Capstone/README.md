Capstone project on Electrical Actuator Design collaborating with Rolls Royce company in the final year. It is the inter-curriculum project with integration of Engineering Product Design and Engineering System Design. 

Being the only one from a different major (ESD), I have self-learned a lot of knowledge on electrical engineering and mechanism  and support the whole project with strong mathematics and programming skills.

I supported the whole team with mathematics and programming skills in aspects of engine simulation, sensor damping control, test experiment design and formulating regression models of fail-safe system.
