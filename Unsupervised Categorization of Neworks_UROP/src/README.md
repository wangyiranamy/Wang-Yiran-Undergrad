This Undergraduate Research Project regarding unsupervised categorisation of networks contains two parts:

1. Re-generate the supervised classification results in the paper "Classification of Synthetic Networks"
2. Apply the Max-Relevance Min Redundancy feature selection method. Our code is inheriting an online Github source code  with modification in the zip file. "mrmr-0.9.2.tar"
3. The implementation of LDA method on the unsupervised network classification.

*** part of the source data is included in 'network.csv' file****

Findings and results are summarised in the final poster.
