Course: Network Modelling

Project Name: Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED)

Description: Utilise the generation of networks to analyse the political violence and protest data for developing countries. The network nodes represent the action parties, while the edges illustrates the number of conflicts/fatalities between two parties. The network also reveals insightful information with network statistics on centrality, degree, largest component, modularity and so on.

Data:  http://www.acleddata.com/data/version-6-data-1997-2015/
The dataset encodes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and protest events, the parties involved and number of fatalities
