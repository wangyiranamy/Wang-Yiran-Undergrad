This module provides a BitVector class with expansive capabilities.  The entire module was
implemented by Avinash Kak.  This version of his BitVector module corresponds to the 1.5.1
release of his library.  The remainder of comments in this file are the originals from
the BitVector class.

Constructing Bit Vectors
------------------------

 You can construct a bit vector in six different ways.

 (1) You can construct a bit vector directly from either a tuple
     or a list of bits, as in

        bv =  BitVector( bitlist = [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1] ) 

 (2) You can construct a bit vector from an integer by

        bv =  BitVector( intVal = 56789 )

     The bits stored now will correspond to the binary
     representation of the integer.  The resulting bit vector is
     the shortest possible bit vector for the integer value
     supplied.  For example, when intVal is 0, the bit vector
     constructed will consist of just the bit 0.


 (3) When initializing a bit vector with an intVal as shown
     above, you can also specify a size for the bit vector:

        bv = BitVector( intVal = 0, size = 8 )

     will return the bit vector consisting of the bit pattern
     00000000.  The zero padding needed for meeting the size
     requirement is always on the left.  If the size supplied is
     smaller than what it takes to create the shortest possible
     bit vector for intVal, an exception is thrown.

         
 (4) You can create a zero-initialized bit vector of a given size
     by

        bv  = BitVector( size = 62 )

     This bit vector will hold exactly 62 bits, all initialized to
     the 0 bit value.

 (5) You can construct a bit vector from a disk file by a two-step
     procedure. First you construct an instance of bit vector by

        bv  =  BitVector( filename = 'somefile' )   

     This bit vector itself is incapable of holding the bits.  To
     now create bit vectors that actually hold the bits, you need
     to make the following sort of a call on the above variable
     bv:

        bv1 =  bv.read_bits_from_file( 64 )    

     bv1 will be a regular bit vector containing 64 bits from the
     disk file. If you want to re-read a file from the beginning
     for some reason, you must obviously first close the file
     object that was acquired with a call to the BitVector
     constructor with a filename argument.  This can be
     accomplished by

       bv.close_file_object()

 (6) You can construct a bit vector from a string of 1's and 0's
     by

        bv  =  BitVector( bitstring = '110011110000' )      

 (7) Yet another way to construct a bit vector is to read the bits
     directly from a file-like object, as in

        x = &quot;111100001111&quot;
        fileobj = StringIO.StringIO( x )
        bv = BitVector( fp = fileobj )



Operations Supported By the BitVector Class
-------------------------------------------

Displaying Bit Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the BitVector class implements the __str__ method, a
bit vector can be displayed on a terminal by

::

        print bitvec

Basically, you can always obtain the string representation
of a bit vector by

::

        str( bitvec )

and integer value by

::
        
        int( bitvec )

Accessing and Setting Individual Bits and Slices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 2)  Any single bit of a bit vector bv can be set to 1 or 0 by

           bv[M] = 1_or_0
           print bv[M]

     for accessing (and setting) the bit at the position that is
     indexed M.  You can retrieve the bit at position M by bv[M].

 3)  A slice of a bit vector obtained by

           bv[i:j]

     is a bit vector constructed from the bits at index positions
     from i through j-1.

 4)  You can also carry out slice assignment:

           bv1 = BitVector( size = 25 )
           bv2 = BitVector( bitstring = '1010001' )
           bv1[6:9]  = bv2[0:3]
           bv3 = BitVector( bitstring = '101' )                 
           bv1[0:3]  = bv3

     The first slice assignment will set the 6th, 7th, and 
     the 8th bits of the bit vector bv1 according to the first
     three bits of bv2.  The second slice assignment will set
     the first three bits of bv1 according to the three bits
     in bv3.

 5)  You can iterate over a bit vector, as illustrated by

           for bit in bitvec:
               print bit,   

     This is made possible by the override definition for the
     special __iter__() method.

 6)  Negative subscripts for array-like indexing are supported.
     Therefore,

           bitvec[ -i ]

     is legal assuming that the index range is not violated.

 7)  You can reset a previously constructed bit vector to
     either the all zeros state or the all ones state by

           bv1 = BitVector( size = 25 )
           ...
           ...
           bv1.reset( 1 )
           ...
           ...
           bv1.reset( 0 )

     The first call to reset() will set all the bits of
     bv1 to 1's and the second call all bit to 0's.

Logical Operations on Bit Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 8) Given two bit vectors bv1 and bv2, you can perform bitwise
    logical operations on them by

           result_bv  =  bv1 ^ bv2
           result_bv  =  bv1 &amp; bv2
           result_bv  =  bv1 | bv2
           result_bv  =  ~bv1


Comparing Bit Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 9) Given two bit vectors bv1 and bv2, you can carry out the
    following comparisons that return Boolean values:

           bv1 ==  bv2
           bv1 !=  bv2
           bv1 &lt;   bv2
           bv1 &lt;=  bv2
           bv1 &gt;   bv2
           bv1 &gt;=  bv2

    The equalities and inequalities are determined by the integer
    values associated with the bit vectors.

Other Supported Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

10)  You can permute and un-permute bit vectors:

           bv_permuted   =  bv.permute( permutation_list )

           bv_unpermuted =  bv.unpermute( permutation_list )


11)  Left and right circular rotations can be carried out by

           bitvec  &lt;&lt; N 

           bitvec  &gt;&gt; N

     for circular rotations to the left and right by N bit
     positions.


12)  A bit vector containing an even number of bits can be
     divided into two equal parts by

           [left_half, right_half] = bitvec.divide_into_two()

      where left_half and right_half hold references to the two
      returned bit vectors.


13)  You can find the integer value of a bit array by

           bitvec.invValue()

     or by

           int( bitvec )


14)  You can convert a bit vector into its string representation
     by

           str( bitvec )


15)  Because __add__ is supplied, you can always join two
     bit vectors by

           bitvec3  =  bitvec1  +  bitvec2

     bitvec3 is a new bit vector that contains all the
     bits of bitvec1 followed by all the bits of bitvec2.

      
16)  You can write a bit vector directly to a file, as
     illustrated by the following example that reads one bit
     vector from a file and then writes it to another
     file

           bv = BitVector( filename = 'input.txt' )
           bv1 = bv.read_bits_from_file(64)        
           print bv1           
           FILEOUT = open( 'output.bits', 'wb' )
           bv1.write_to_file( FILEOUT )
           FILEOUT.close()
           bv = BitVector( filename = 'output.bits' )
           bv2 = bv.read_bits_from_file( 64 )
           print bv2

      IMPORTANT:  The size of bit vector must be a multiple of
                  of 8 for this write function to work.  If this
                  condition is not met, the function throws an
                  exception.

      IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:  When writing an internally
                  generated bit vector out to a disk file, it
                  is important to open the file in the binary
                  mode as shown.  Otherwise, the bit pattern
                  00001010 ('\n') in your bitstring will be written 
                  out as 0000110100001010 ('\r\n'), which is the
                  linebreak on Windows machine.

17)  You can also write a bit vector directly to a stream
     object, as illustrated by

           fp_write = StringIO.StringIO()
           bitvec.write_bits_to_fileobject( fp_write )
           print fp_write.getvalue()         # 111100001111 
      

18)  You can pad a bit vector from the left or from the
     right with a designated number of zeros

           bitvec.pad_from_left( n )

           bitvec.pad_from_right( n )

     In the first case, the new bit vector will be the same
     as the old bit vector except for the additional n zeros
     on the left.  The same thing happens in the second
     case except that now the additional n zeros will be on
     the right.

19)  You can test if a bit vector x is contained in another bit
     vector y by using the syntax 'if x in y'.  This is made
     possible by the override definition for the special
     __contains__() method.

20)  You can count the number of bits set in a BitVector 
     instance by

       bv = BitVector( bitstring = '100111' )
       print bv.count_bits()                     # 4

21)  You can change the bit pattern associated with a
     previously constructed BitVector instance:

       bv = BitVector( intVal = 7, size =16 )
       print bv                              # 0000000000000111
       bv.setValue( intVal = 45 )
       print bv                              # 101101
       

How the Bit Vectors are Stored
------------------------------

 The bits of a bit array are stored in 16-bit unsigned ints.
 After resolving the argument with which the constructor is
 called (which happens in lines (A2) through (A70) of the file
 BitVector.py), the very first thing that the constructor does is
 to figure out in line (A78) as to how many of those 2-byte ints
 it needs for the bits.  For example, if you wanted to store a
 64-bit array, the variable 'two_byte_ints_needed' in line (A78)
 would be set to 4. (This does not mean that the size of a bit
 vector must be a multiple of 16.  Any sized bit vectors can
 constructed using the required number of two-byte ints.) Line
 (A79) then creates an array of 2-byte ints and initializes it
 with the required number of zeros.  Lines (A80) then shifts the
 bits into the array of two-byte ints.

 As mentioned above, note that it is not necessary for the size
 of the vector to be a multiple of 16 even though we are using
 C's unsigned short as as a basic unit for storing the bit
 arrays.  The class BitVector keeps track of the actual number of
 bits in the bit vector through the &quot;size&quot; instance attribute.

 With regard to the code in lines (A2) through (A77) of the file
 BitVector.py, note that, except for one case, the constructor
 must be called with a single keyword argument, which determines
 how the bit vector will be constructed.  The single exception to
 this rule is for the keyword argument 'intVal' which can be used
 along with the 'size' keyword argument.  When 'intVal' is used
 with the 'size' option, the bit vector constructed for the
 integer is the shortest possible bit vector.  On the other hand,
 when 'size' is also specified, the bit vector is padded with
 zeroes from the left so that it has the specified size.

 Lines (A16) through (A22) are for the following sort of a call

        bv = BitVector( filename = 'myfilename' )

 This call returns a bit vector on which you must subsequently
 invoke the 'read_bits_from_file()' method to actually obtain a
 bit vector consisting of the bits that constitute the
 information stored in the file.

 Lines (A23) through (A28) are for the case when you want to
 construct a bit vector by reading the bits off a file-like
 object, as in

       x = &quot;111100001111&quot;
       fileobj = StringIO.StringIO( x )
       bv = BitVector( fp = fileobj )

 Lines (A29) through (A61) are for the case when you want to
 construct a bit vector from an integer, as in

       bv = BitVector( intVal = 123456 )

 The bits stored in the bit vector will correspond to the binary
 representation of the integer argument provided.  The bit vector
 constructed with the above call will be the shortest possible
 bit vector for the integer supplied.  As a case in point, when
 the intVal is 0, the bit vector will consist of a single bit
 which will be 0 also.  The code in lines (A27) through (A59) can
 also handle the following sort of a call

       bv = BitVector( intVal = 46, size = 16 )        

 which returns a bit vector of a specfic size by padding the
 shortest possible bit vector the the intVal with zeros from the
 left.
 
 Lines (A62) through (A68) are for constructing a bit vector with
 just the size information, as in

       bv = BitVector( size = 61 )

 This returns a bit vector that will hold exactly 61 bits, all
 initialized to the zero value.

 Lines (A69) through (A73) are for constructing a bit vector from
 a bitstring, as in

       bv = BitVector( bitstring = '00110011111' )

 Finally, lines (A74) through (A77) are for constructing a bit
 vector from a list or a tuple of the individual bits:
   
       bv = BitVector( bitlist = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1) )

 The bit vector constructed is initialized with the supplied
 bits.



Acknowledgements
----------------

 The author is grateful to Oleg Broytmann for suggesting many
 improvements that were incorporated in Version 1.1 of this
 package.  The author would like to thank Kurt Schwehr whose
 email resulted in the creation of Version 1.2.  Kurt also caught
 an error in my earlier version of 'setup.py' and suggested a
 unittest based approach to the testing of the package.  Kurt
 also supplied the Makefile that is included in this
 distribution.  The author would also like to thank all (Scott
 Daniels, Blair Houghton, and Steven D'Aprano) for their
 responses to my comp.lang.python query concerning how to make a
 Python input stream peekable.  This feature was included in
 Version 1.1.1.

 With regard to the changes incorporated in Version 1.3, thanks
 are owed to Kurt Schwehr and Gabriel Ricardo for bringing to my
 attention the bug related to the intVal method of initializing a
 bit vector when the value of intVal exceeded sys.maxint. This
 problem is fixed in Version 1.3.  Version 1.3 also includes many
 other improvements that make the syntax better conform to the
 standard idioms of Python.  These changes and the addition of
 the new constructor mode (that allows a bit vector of a given
 size to be constructed from an integer value) are also owing to
 Kurt's suggestions.

 With regard to the changes incorporated in Version 1.3.1, I
 would like to thank Michael Haggerty for noticing that the
 bitwise logical operators resulted in bit vectors that had their
 bits packed into lists of ints, as opposed to arrays of 
 unsigned shorts.  This inconsistency in representation has been 
 removed in version 1.3.1.  Michael has also suggested that 
 since BitVector is mutable, I should be overloading __iand__(), 
 __ior__(), etc., for in-place modifications of bit vectors.  
 Michael certainly makes a good point. But I am afraid that this 
 change will break the code for the existing users of the 
 BitVector class. 

 I thank Mathieu Roy for bringing to my attention the problem
 with writing bitstrings out to a disk files on Windows 
 machines.  This turned out to be a problem more with the
 documentation than with the BitVector class itself.  On a 
 Windows machine, it is particularly important that a file
 you are writing a bitstring into be opened in binary mode
 since otherwise the bit pattern 00001010 ('\n') will be written 
 out as 0000110100001010 ('\r\n').  This documentation fix 
 resulted in Version 1.3.2.

 With regard to Version 1.4, the suggestions/bug reports
 made by John Kominek, Bob Morse, and Steve Ward contributed
 to this version.  I wish to thank all three. John wanted me 
 to equip the class with a reset() method so that a previously
 constructed class could be reset to either all 0's or all
 1's. Bob spotted loose local variables in the implementation
 --- presumably left over from a debugging phase of the code.
 Bob recommended that I clean up the code with pychecker. That
 has been done.  Steve noticed that slice assignment was not
 working.  It should work now.

 Version 1.4.1 was prompted by John Kominek suggesting that
 if reset() returned self, then the slice operation could
 be combined with the reset operation.  Thanks John!  Another
 reason for 1.4.1 was to remove the discrepancy between the 
 value of the __copyright__ variable in the module and the 
 value of license variable in setup.py.  This discrepancy 
 was brought to my attention by David Eyk.  Thanks David!

 Version 1.5 has benefited greatly by the suggestions made
 by Ryan Cox.  By examining the BitVector execution with
 cProfile, Ryan observed that my implementation was making
 unnecessary method calls to _setbit() when just the size
 option is used for constructing a BitVector instance.
 Since Python allocates cleaned up memory, it is unnecessary 
 to set the individual bits of a vector if it is known in 
 advance that they are all zero. Ryan made a similar observation 
 for the logical operations applied to two BitVector instances 
 of equal length.  He noticed that I was making unnecessary 
 calls to _resize_pad_from_left() for the case of equal 
 arguments to logical operations.  Ryan also recommended that 
 I include a method that returns the total number of bits 
 set in a BitVector instance.  The new method count_bits() does 
 exactly that. Thanks Ryan for all your suggestions.
 Version 1.5 also includes the method setValue() that allows 
 the internally stored bit pattern associated with a previously
 constructed BitVector to be changed.  A need for this method
 was expressed by Aleix Conchillo.  Thanks Aleix.
 
 Version 1.5.1 is a quick release to fix a bug in the 
 right circular shift operator.  This bug was discovered
 by Jasper Spaans.  Thanks very much Jasper.

  <p>If this function can read all blocksize bits, it peeks ahead to see if
  there is anything more to be read in the file. It uses tell-read-seek 
  mechanism for this in lines (R18) through (R21).  If there is nothing 
  further to be read, it sets the more_to_read attribute of the bitvector 
  object to False.  Obviously, this can only be done for seekable streams 
  such as those connected with disk files.  According to Blair Houghton, a 
  similar feature could presumably be implemented for socket streams by 
  using recv() or recvfrom() if you set the flags argument to MSG_PEEK.</p>
